# TypeScript Learning 

## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, adding optional static typing to the language.

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript is a syntactical superset of JavaScript, which means that any valid JavaScript is also valid TypeScript. 

TypeScript also adds static typing to JavaScript, which allows for compile-time type checking. 

This can help catch errors early in the development process, improving code quality and reducing the number of bugs.
